# multithreaded_web_server
Multithreaded Web Server application from [The Rust Programming Language Chapter 20](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).

This was a great project. I was able to practice the content we had seen throughout the book and learn a bit about web protocols.

This finishes the book, and I thoroughly enjoyed it!
